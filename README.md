## Game Description
Our project is a small recreation of the famous retro game called 
Oregon Trail by MECC. The player is put in the shoes of an emigrant
traveling from Indepndence, Missouri to Oregon City, Oregon in 
search of a new life. In order to reach their destination, the player
must be able to survive the trail using supplies they get from the 
start and along the way, and braving whatever misfortunes they 
encounter.
